Hi, I'm David

I'm a QA Software Test Engineer certified by ISTQB, with hands-on experience in manual testing, bug reporting, and test case design.  

 What you'll find here:                                          
These are SQL queries that I wrote in my course.                
All the queries I executed on the database used at John Bryce College called 'Northwind'        
For the SQL learning we used Microsoft's SQL Server (T-SQL).


 Queries Types:
- scalar functions 
- group aggregates
- Subqueries
- inner join
- left/right join
